Script:
1 and 2)
This is a prologue for the main game. It serves as a cutscene and doesn't really have any actual gameplay.
The story is that a man finds himself in a graveyard, where he is greeted by an angel.
The angel transforms his body and places him in an unknown world, leaving him with a sword to defend
himself against demons that seem to appear out of nowhere.

The character is controlled using the keyboard: A for left, D for right, W for jump and S for attack.
The aim of the game is to defeat as many demons as possible within 60 seconds.
If 60 seconds have passed, if a demon catches you, or if you fall down to the spikes below, then the game ends.

A new enemy appears somewhere in the game world every 2 seconds, then disappears after 10 seconds.

After you die, the game displays your final score and your high score. You can press R to restart the main game.

3)
By far, the main challenge I encountered was achieving a seamless transition between the prologue and the main game.
Getting the audio to work correctly was also quite challenging.

4)
The lessons I learned included: handling null pointer exceptions, using abstract classes and interfaces
and maximising encapsulation.
